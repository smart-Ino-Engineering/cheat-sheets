# Docker Deployment Guide

This guide helps you deploy microservices using Docker, Traefik, and Django.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Domain name with DNS pointing to server IP
- Ports 80/443 open on firewall

## Setup Steps

1. **Configure Environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Fill in your values
   ```

2. **Customize Deployment Files**

   Replace placeholders in template files:
   - `DOMAIN` - Your base domain (e.g., example.com)
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Your admin email for Let's Encrypt notifications

3. **Build and Start Services**

   ```bash
   chmod +x entrypoint.sh
   ./entrypoint.sh
   ```

4. **Verify Service Health**

   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker logs user_management
   ```

## Configuration Reference

### Critical Customization Points

#### In docker-compose.yml

- `traefik.http.routers.traefik-dashboard.rule`: Update dashboard domain
- `traefik.http.routers.user_management.rule`: Update Microservice domain

#### In traefik.yml

- `certificatesResolvers.letsencrypt.acme.email`: Valid admin email

#### In .env

```ini
POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strong_password
REDIS_PASSWORD=strong_redis_password
SECRET_KEY=django_secret_key
```

### Verification

Access services:

- Microservice: <https://your-domain.com>
- Traefik Dashboard: <https://traefik.your-domain.com>

Check logs:

```bash
docker logs user_management
docker logs traefik
```

### Troubleshooting

- **301 Redirect Loops**: Verify `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` in Django settings
- **Certificate Issues**: Check Traefik logs with `docker logs traefik`
- **Connection Timeouts**: Verify DNS propagation and firewall settings

## Project Components

1. **Docker Compose File**
   - Path: `docker-compose.yml`
   - Purpose: Defines all services and their configurations

2. **Traefik Configuration**
   - Path: `traefik.yml`
   - Purpose: Configures the reverse proxy for SSL and routing

3. **Entrypoint Script**
   - Path: `entrypoint.sh`
   - Purpose: Initializes the Docker environment

4. **Run Service Script**
   - Path: `run-service.sh`
   - Purpose: Starts Django services within the container

5. **Environment Variables**
   - Path: `env.example`
   - Purpose: Template for required environment variables

## Conclusion

This deployment guide provides the essential steps to get your microservices running with Docker, Traefik, and Django. Following these instructions will give you a production-ready environment with secure HTTPS connections, database persistence, and proper service isolation.

The setup is designed to be both secure and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for further customization and scaling as your application grows.

## Todo

While this guide covers the basics of deployment, there are several areas that could be improved or expanded upon:

- Implementing robust monitoring and logging solutions
- Adding detailed backup and restore procedures
- Enhancing security configurations
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments
- Adding scaling configurations for high-traffic scenarios
